# LICT JAVA TUP BRAC 13

## Getting Started

### Instructions for the time being:

* Install git from [git-scm](http://git-scm.com/).
* Create a folder in your Computer name it whatever you like.
    > for example - "LICT"/ "TOP UP IT"
* To create the folder using commandline:
  * Open commandline and get to the directory where you want to create the repository.
  * Write: 
    ```
    mkdir "Folder Name"
    ```
    * If the folder name contains a space or a blank character in between, you'll wrap the words in quote.
* Open Command line and get to that directory.
* Write: 
    ```
    git init
    ```
* Write: 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/raysrmr/BRAC_JAVA.git
    ```
* Everytime something changes in the repo, you can just write: 
    ```
    git pull
    ```
* You may set your username and password globally (only on your personal computer) so git will not ask you to enter them everytime. 
  * To do that follow [this](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/).

## Tasks:
- [x] Uploads the codes done by sir.

```
